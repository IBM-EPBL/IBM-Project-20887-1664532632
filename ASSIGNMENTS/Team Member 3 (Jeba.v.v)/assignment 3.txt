Answer the questions or complete the tasks outlined in bold below, use the specific method described if applicable.

** What is 7 to the power of 4?**

In [1]:
7**4
Out[1]:
2401
** Split this string:**

s = "Hi there Sam!"

into a list.

In [4]:
s = "Hi there Sam!"
t = s.split()
In [5]:
print(t)
['Hi', 'there', 'Sam!']
** Given the variables:**

planet = "Earth"
diameter = 12742

** Use .format() to print the following string: **

The diameter of Earth is 12742 kilometers.
In [9]:
planet = "Earth"
diameter = 12742
In [10]:
print(" The diameter of {0} is {1} kilometers.".format(planet,diameter))
 The diameter of Earth is 12742 kilometers.
** Given this nested list, use indexing to grab the word "hello" **

In [12]:
lst = [1,2,[3,4],[5,[100,200,['hello']],23,11],1,7]
In [13]:
lst[3][1][2][0]
Out[13]:
'hello'
** Given this nest dictionary grab the word "hello". Be prepared, this will be annoying/tricky **

In [14]:
d = {'k1':[1,2,3,{'tricky':['oh','man','inception',{'target':[1,2,3,'hello']}]}]}
In [15]:
d['k1'][3]['tricky'][3]['target'][3]
Out[15]:
'hello'
** What is the main difference between a tuple and a list? **

In [16]:
# Tuples are immutable, and are denoted by paranthesis; they are also faster and don't have as many built in methods as lists.
# Lists however are mutable, and are denoted by square brackets; they are relatively slower but have a lot of built in methods.
** Create a function that grabs the email website domain from a string in the form: **

user@domain.com

So for example, passing "user@domain.com" would return: domain.com

In [17]:
def returnDomain(mail):
  return mail.split('@')[-1]
In [18]:
returnDomain("user@domain.com")
Out[18]:
'domain.com'
** Create a basic function that returns True if the word 'dog' is contained in the input string. Don't worry about edge cases like a punctuation being attached to the word dog, but do account for capitalization. **

In [20]:
def hasDog(str):
  return 'dog' in str.lower()
In [21]:
hasDog("ThIs DoGgo is quite cute")
Out[21]:
True
** Create a function that counts the number of times the word "dog" occurs in a string. Again ignore edge cases. **

In [24]:
def countDogs(doggo):
  count = 0
  for i in doggo.lower().split():
    if 'dog' in i:
      count += 1
  return count
In [25]:
countDogs("ThIs DoGgo is a cute doggo")
Out[25]:
2
Problem
You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write a function to return one of 3 possible results: "No ticket", "Small ticket", or "Big Ticket". If your speed is 60 or less, the result is "No Ticket". If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is "Small Ticket". If speed is 81 or more, the result is "Big Ticket". Unless it is your birthday (encoded as a boolean value in the parameters of the function) -- on your birthday, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.

In [27]:
def caught_speeding(speed, is_birthday):
    
    if is_birthday:
        speeding = speed - 5
    else:
        speeding = speed
    
    if speeding > 80:
        return 'Big Ticket'
    elif speeding > 60:
        return 'Small Ticket'
    else:
        return 'No Ticket'
In [31]:
caught_speeding(90,True)
Out[31]:
'Big Ticket'
In [29]:
caught_speeding(81,True)
Out[29]:
'Small Ticket'
Create an employee list with basic salary values(at least 5 values for 5 employees) and using a for loop retreive each employee salary and calculate total salary expenditure.

In [43]:
employee = ['Shyam','Balan','Haris','Pooja','Ramya']
salary = [10000,20000,30000,40000,50000]
totalExpenditure = 0
In [44]:
for i in range(len(employee)):
  print("Employee {}'s salary is : {}".format(employee[i],salary[i]))
  totalExpenditure += salary[i]

print("The total salary expenditure for the company is ",totalExpenditure)
Employee Shyam's salary is : 10000
Employee Balan's salary is : 20000
Employee Haris's salary is : 30000
Employee Pooja's salary is : 40000
Employee Ramya's salary is : 50000
The total salary expenditure for the company is  150000
Create two dictionaries in Python:

First one to contain fields as Empid, Empname, Basicpay

Second dictionary to contain fields as DeptName, DeptId.

Combine both dictionaries.

In [47]:
dict1 = {"Empid":1,"Empname":"Shyam","Basicpay":40000}
dict2 = {"DeptName":"Product Design","DepId":101}
dict1.update(dict2)
print(dict1)
{'Empid': 1, 'Empname': 'Shyam', 'Basicpay': 40000, 'DeptName': 'Product Design', 'DepId': 101}
